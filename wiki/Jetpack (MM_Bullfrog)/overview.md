# Overview

This addon seeks to implement a jetpack framework. More specifically, this intends to allow modders, players, and units to easily create and manage wearable items that impart velocity upon the player.

This is done with an energy system, for game balencing and realism purposes. However, built-in customizable settings can nullify the impact of this system if you so wish.
