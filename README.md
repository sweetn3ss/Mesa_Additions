<h1> Mesa's Additions Github Repository </h1>

Name Pending Change!!!


This is the repository to host the modularly applicable functions for OPTRE unit mods. These systems should, in theory, work for any unit in any genre of Arma 3, though they may have some issues if OPTRE is not present in the given modlist.

<h2> The systems are categorized into the following groups: </h2>

1. Shield Tech

2. Camo Tech

3. Jump Pack Tech

4. Spartan Laser

Each Category has its own intentions, and depending on functional growth, they may be reuploaded as their own distinct mods. This would be intended to minimize modlist size for any units wishing to use some, though not all, of the systems provided.

<h2> Shield Tech </h2>

The shield tech is currently only a bubble shield, as seen in Halo 3, and Halo: Reach. This may be expanded upon in the future, depending on scripting hang-ups, as well as time able to be spent on expansion. Some assets are ready to expand the shield systems, though by no means does this guarantee their implementation.

<h2> Camo Tech </h2>

The camo tech is intended to be a modular system geared toward allowing infantry of any unit to easily and swiftly swap between a multitude of camo presets made by said unit's mod team. The system is rather simple, and only requires server settings be updated alongside minor config updates. Appropriate textures must also be managed, though the script itself will do the rest of the work.

<h2> Jump Pack Tech PENDING REWORK </h2>

Jump packs are notoriously hard to get right in most of Arma 3, due to limitations imposed either by the engine or mods used within the engine. To combat this, our systems are intended to be as easy to configure as possible. The only modifications needed to an existing unit mod will be config-based that should not interfere with normal operations.

<h2> Spartan Laser </h2>

The Spartan Laser, or M6G Grindell/Galilean Non-Linear Rifle, is a staple of Halo as a genre, and its absence from the Arma 3 Halo community is not unnoticed. The model is also used(with permission) in OPAEX, though some may prefer its implementation here rather than there.

<h2> Closing Statement </h2>

All contributing developers to this project wish only the smoothest of integrations with our items into any unit's average playstyle. With that in mind, please feel free to contact Mesa through Discord at "mommy mesa#1312" if you have any issues with any of our systems, or if you would like to contribute to our project.

Note that some updates that reach this repository may not reach the Steam Workshop build of the mod. This is intentional, likely due to apparent bugs, issues, or inconsistencies with our systems that need to be refined before live release.
